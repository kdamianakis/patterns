ExplanatoryUiUx is a Web Application UI-UX pattern that allows a user manual link to be associated with a UI/UX component, 
thus allowing user journey to be easier. 

- This could apply to a range of Web components such as TextArea, TextField, 
Custom components and any visible element.
- The user can follow the link which could open on a new window, 
  an inline window or even an iFrame (perhaps) or any application or plarform that would allow a 
  set of text and images to guide the user in knowing better what to place in the field.
  - Can be associated with a WIKI or Knowledge base of some kind
  - Can utilise a URL Shortener
  - Can allow for Frequently Asked Questions to be associated with the description of the field, 
    or include other links to assist the user in adding the correct information to the web application
