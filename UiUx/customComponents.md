##### Custom components pattern

When using a framework (such as BOOTSTRAP, etc) or any UI components that have been inherited by other projects:
  - create your own version of each of these components
    - this way you can define different styles - directly or via utilising a JSON pattern
    - you can add specific options represented in UI and pass (via ReactJS Props or other language dependent mechanisms) 
        parameters that become visuallised. this can include STYLESHEET components and DEFAULT position for the elements
Better still, you can **i future** easily manipulate those components as it would no longer require for new fixed components to be creted
  - this would allow FLEXIBLE and REUSABLE libraries of components to be utilised for a range of projects
